# ortophoto-osm
This is public code repository for Lithuania geospatial data segmentation. It is used by Kaunas University of Technology scientists. The code is used for investigation of neural networks using openstreetmap database as labeling source. More detail are in "Urban Change Detection from Aerial Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning" paper.

**note: due to sheer size of volume and data licensing the project have direct links in storage which need to be modified acordingly including EPSG transformations**

## Required data
* Ortophoto https://www.geoportal.lt/geoportal/en/web/en - ~12Tb raw data (it can be smaller after compression)
* OpenStreetmap https://planet.openstreetmap.org/ - for this model we used full country Lithuania, but for other data it necessary to filter by boundaries

## Project specifics
Project main requirements are:
* mxnet
* gluon-cv
* GDAL python packages
* diskcache
* expiringdict
* shapely
* rasterio
* pyproj
* mpi4py

it can be installed in conda envirioment:
```
$ mamba install -c conda-forge mxnet gdal diskcache expiringdict shapely rasterio pyproj mpi4py
$ pip install gluon-cv
```
## Licensing

The Data licence is different:
* Ortophoto is from  SE "GIS-Centras" is the manager of the Spatial Information Portal of Lithuania -  https://www.geoportal.lt/geoportal/en/web/en 
* OpenStreetMap - OpenStreetMapÂ®  https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
* The code by default is licenced as The 3-Clause BSD License unless is noticed differently
